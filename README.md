**The Browser-Bruter** is first ever browser based automated web pentesting tool for fuzzing **web forms** by controlling the browser it self. It automates the process of sending **payloads** to input fields of browser and sends them too server. It completely **bypasses** the need of breaking the **encryption** in order to fuzz and insert payloads in BurpSuite scanner and intruder. After fuzzing it generates a **comprehensive report** including all the data and result of the pentest along with HTTP traffic, this report can be viewed by **The Report-Explorer** tool which comes with The Browser-Bruter.

**Handcrafted in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³**
